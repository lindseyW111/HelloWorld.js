# JavaScript CS-330
## History
  Invented in 1995 by Brendan Eich, it took Eich 10 days to write the program. The programming language was designed to aid Netscape's communicationâ€™s flagship web browser, as a scripting language. In 1997 it was handed to ECMA.  It is important to note that java and javascript are in no way related. After the release other companies started using the program. Sadly in its infancy the program had security and performance issues. But Javascript took a turn in 2008 when Chrome V8, Google's open source, was able to use Javascript as a high performance engine.
