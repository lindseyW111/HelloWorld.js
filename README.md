# JavaScript CS-330
## History
  Invented in 1995 by Brendan Eich, it took Eich 10 days to write the program. The programming language was designed to aid Netscape's communicationâ€™s flagship web browser, as a scripting language. In 1997 it was handed to ECMA.  It is important to note that java and javascript are in no way related. After the release other companies started using the program. Sadly in its infancy the program had security and performance issues. But Javascript took a turn in 2008 when Chrome V8, Google's open source, was able to use Javascript as a high performance engine. 
## Getting Started on Mac
1. Download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for Mac
2. On VSCode download the extension JavaScript (ES6) Code Snippet.
3. Next you have to download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) for Mac.
4. This will then allow you to run JavaScropt on VSCode.

## Hello World Program
This is the code to run Hello World in JavaScript

Input:

    console.log('Hello World!')
   

Output:

     // Two forward slashes is how you comment
    //  The code above outputs this into the terminal 
   
    Hello World!

## Naming

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, and weakly typed.  Variable names must start with a letter underscore _ or the dollar sign $ and they cannot include spaces. It is also standard practice to name variables with camelCase, and have spaces around operators and commas. Also to use code indentions (2 spaces) when writing code blocks (everything except the first line of the block is indentented). While simple samples end in semicolons. 

#### Mutable vs immutable 
There are only two mutable variables in JavaScript Arrays and Objects.
#### Limitations
1. Does not do multi threading
2. Can not do big numbers
3. Lack of reading and writing capabilities on the client side.
4. Limitations of networking.
